# Instagram_filters.py
We  have used Instagram once in your life, have you noticed that you see a variety of Instagram filters when uploading an image. 
These filters are designed to improve the quality of the image. 
These filters are an example of complex machine learning algorithms that are deployed in production to serve Instagram. 

install this library by using the pip command – pip install instafilter. I hope you will not get any errors while installing this library.

The other library we need for creating Instagram filters is the Open Source Computer Vision Library of Python which is OpenCV.
If you have never worked with OpenCV you can easily install it by using a pip command – pip install opencv-python. 
To use OpenCV we do not import it by the same name, we import it by the name of cv2 (import cv2). Let’s create Instagram filters with Python
